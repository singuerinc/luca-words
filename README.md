# Swedish word of the day

Another _"Word of the day website"_... I know.

## Why

Because I live in Sweden and I am learning Swedish. This is a way to learn new words everytime I open my browser.

## What

A project to test/learn more about some technologies:

- React
- Lambda
- RSS parsing
- Yandex Dictionary API
- Typescript

## Features

- Display the word English and a translation in Swedish
- Themes: Night, Cloudy, Sunny

## Known issues

- The Swedish translation is done by the Yandex Dictionary, so it is not 100% accurate
- Some words are not relevant... since the list is taken from the 10000 most common words in Google Search
- Not all translations are available
